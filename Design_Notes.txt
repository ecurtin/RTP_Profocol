Is your protocol non-pipelined (such as Stop-and-Wait) or pipelined (such as Selective Repeat)?
Protocol is pipelined with selective repeat style handling


Can your protocol handle lost packets?


Can your protocol handle corrupted packets?
Can your protocol handle duplicate packets?
Can your protocol handle out-of-order packets?
Can your protocol support bi-directional data transfers?
Does your protocol use a non-trivial checksum algorithm (i.e., anything more sophisticated than the IP checksum)?
Does your protocol have any other special features for which you request extra credit? Please include a short summary of these features here (even if you describe them in more detail later in the report).
